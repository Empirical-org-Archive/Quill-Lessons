  - case @score.state
  - when 'unstarted'
    p It seems like you haven't started yet. Try #{link_to 'Starting from the beginning', chapter_path(@chapter.id)}.
  - when 'practice'
    p= link_to 'Resume your practice', chapter_resume_path(@chapter.id)
  - when 'finished'
    p Looks like you're done! #{link_to 'Review your score here', chapter_final_path(@chapter.id)}.
